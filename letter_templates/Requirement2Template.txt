The petition was found to have an inadequate number of lot designations. Pursuant to Florida Statute 723.037(5)(a), a majority of affected homeowners must designate the committee in writing to represent homeowners in disputing the change in question.  With %s affected homeowners in the park, %s lot designations are required. Careful review of the petition provided a total of %s valid designations that were counted. Designations without lot numbers, crossed-out designations, and the noted %s duplicate designations in the petition could not be counted toward mediation. Please submit at minimum an additional %s valid, non-duplicate lot designations in order to correct this deficiency.
